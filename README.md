# Hi, I'm MartÃ­n! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th Year MEng Computer Science (Human Computer Interaction) student at the University of Manchester. I previously did a one year FED internship @zebratechnologies.

Outside of university, I just remade my [personal website](https://cumartinal.com) entirely using React and Gatsby. While I still need to polish it, you can a look at the code [in its repository](https://github.com/cumartinal/personal-website).

Currently searching for graduate opportunities in London, UK, so while you're here, why not take a look at my [CV](https://cumartinal.com/static/CV_Martin_Cuesta_Allende-0359ed3875dc74ae542d41fdf053ba32.pdf)?
