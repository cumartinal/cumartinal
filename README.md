# Hi, I'm MartÃ­n! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist and a MEng Computer Science (Human Computer Interaction) graduate. I previously did a one year FED internship @zebratechnologies.

Outside of work, I just remade my [personal website](https://cumartinal.com) entirely using React and Gatsby. While I still need to polish it, you can a look at the code [in its repository](https://github.com/cumartinal/personal-website). Also check out my [treasure trove](https://github.com/cumartinal/treasure-trove) repository, where I plan to post a lot of mini-projects to improve my skills.

While you're here, why not take a look at my [CV](https://cumartinal.com/static/CV_Martin_Cuesta_Allende-c4aa355f45d9532f19aed7732e5dad3b.pdf)?
