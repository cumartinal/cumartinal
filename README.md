# Hi, I'm MartÃ­n! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MEng Computer Science (Human Computer Interaction) graduate. I previously did a one year FED internship @zebratechnologies.

Outside of university, I just remade my [personal website](https://cumartinal.com) entirely using React and Gatsby. While I still need to polish it, you can a look at the code [in its repository](https://github.com/cumartinal/personal-website).

Currently searching for data science graduate opportunities in London, UK, so while you're here, why not take a look at my [CV](https://cumartinal.com/static/CV_Martin_Cuesta_Allende-4ae6cefa94deb233e4441904c2f88485.pdf)?
