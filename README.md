# Hi, I'm MartÃ­n! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th Year MEng Computer Science (Human Computer Interaction) student at the University of Manchester. I previously did a one year FED internship @zebratechnologies.

Outside of university, I'm currently learning how to make websites in React (https://github.com/cumartinal/personal-website) by remaking my [personal website](https://cumartinal.com).

Currently searching for graduate opportunities in London, UK, so while you're here, why not take a look at my [CV](https://cumartinal.com/CV_Martin_Cuesta_Allende.pdf)?
